# Karabiner-Elements Install Instructions

We have two goals here:

  1. Enable a hyper key
  1. Map left caps-locks both to ESC and to CTRL

This is a pain to accomplish. The solution is found in [this comment](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/8#issuecomment-279196849),
which is also copied to this directory in the JPG file.

This works using @wwwjfy's [fork](https://github.com/wwwjfy/Karabiner-Elements/releases/tag/0.90.90) of Karabiner-Elements, using version 0.90.90.
The binary dmg should be found at that link, but it is preserved in this directory for safety sake.

Tested on macOS Sierra 10.12.6
